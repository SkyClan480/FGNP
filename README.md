# Flightgear-Navdata-Parser
Project by TOASTER and SkyClan480

This is a branch of the main repository with the work-in-progress migration from NASR source to CIFP source.
We are changing the project to use the CIFP as its data source in place of the NASR. This is in part because the NASR does not have all of the necessary information for procedures (SID/STAR), but also because the CIFP is one file with all relevant data listed, and is written in the international standard ARINC 424 format. It is to the benefit of the project to convert to using CIFP data, and this branch contains the work on that venture.
